  ready
    -> dispatch -> running
  running
    -> timeout -> ready
    -> event wait -> blocked
    -> release -> exit
  blocked
    -> event occurs -> ready

blocked process
  waiting for long instruction - ex getting stuff from HDD

Suspended process
  none of process is in main memory but thrown in SWAP disk
  basically only suspended if blocked processes are full
  must be explicitly activated to work
