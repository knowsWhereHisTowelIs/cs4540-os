Seg fault:

segments
    using ex program
    0-1)
        0) segments READ
            ex: printf("Hello %s\n", "World");
        1) text section READ
            code and more
                "Hello %s\n", "World" stored here

        where dynamically linked librarys reside -- only link
        not cloned in fork
        
    2) data section READWRITE
        global variables like stdio etc

    3) stack section READWRITE
        local variable such as 'i'
            int main(int argc, char*argv){ int i; ... }
review stack vs queue
    stack FILO?
    queue FIFO?
