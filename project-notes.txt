due week before finals


Writing Device Drivers
    run in kernal mode
    different virtual memory than user mode


download source code from my version of unix/linux (maybe kernal development kit)
compile in debug mode w/optimization shut off

setup 2 machines or virtual machines
    single step in debug running on another machine
    will rewrite part of kernal then debug it

2 choices
    write kernal or install device driver to manipulate the kernal
